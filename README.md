# RNGuessMyNumber

This application was based on the lecture on Udemy course (React Native - The Practical Guide [2022]) by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller 
and Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The main function of this app is to be able to compete with your device in a guessing number game.

## Functions
- Pick a number between (1-99) with validation
- The system will make a guess and the user will pick if the system's guess is "higher" or "lower" with validation 
(The system will check if the user is lying between the "higher" or "lower")
- During the game, it will shows the logging events (List of system's guess per round).
- After completing the game, the app will shows the number of rounds consume by the system to guess the user's number.
